# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


## Additional Packages:

 - appwrite: JavaScript SDK so your frontend (like a React app) can communicate with your Appwrite backend.
 
 - @tinymce/tinymce-react: TinyMCE React integration.

 - react-hook-form: For form handling.

 - html-react-parser: To safely parse HTML from TinyMCE into React components.

 - eslint
What it does:
ESLint is a pluggable linter tool that analyzes your code for potential errors and enforces consistent coding styles.

Think of it as a spell checker for your code.

It helps catch bugs and enforces best practices.

 - ðŸŽ¨ prettier
What it does:
Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces consistent style by parsing your code and reprinting it with its own rules.

It handles things like spacing, semicolons, quotes, and indentation.

Itâ€™s not about linting logic, but formatting style.

 - ðŸ”Œ eslint-plugin-react
What it does:
This is an ESLint plugin that adds React-specific linting rules.

Helps catch errors and enforce best practices in React components.

Example rule: warn if a component is missing key in a list.

 - ðŸ“¦ eslint-config-prettier
What it does:
This disables ESLint rules that conflict with Prettier formatting.

It ensures Prettier and ESLint don't "fight" over code style.

Example: if ESLint wants 2-space indentation but Prettier wants 4 â€” this config prevents a clash.

 - ðŸŽ¯ eslint-plugin-prettier
What it does:
Runs Prettier as an ESLint rule â€” so Prettier issues show up in ESLint output.

Lets you use one tool (eslint) to handle both linting and formatting errors.

Example: If your code isn't formatted, ESLint will show it as a problem.
